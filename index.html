    	<b>Hello everyone!</b><br>
<br>
I'm new here now. My name's Rose. <i>I'm 14 and I come from Germany. My mother’s French and my father’s German, so I’m bilingual. But we mostly speak German at home.</i>  I like ice-skating and singing. My favourite season is winter, because I like snow so much as well. My favourite animal is cat. My cat's name's Lotte. She's cute and I like her. My favourite number is 29 of course. My favourite flower is rose. However I also like field poppy, violet and sunflower. My favourite colour is black, I like pink too. My favourite school subjects are chemistry, mathematics an music.<br>
What’re your hobbies? What do you like?<br>
<br>
Nice to meet all of you!<br><br>
Keep up good,
    </p>
